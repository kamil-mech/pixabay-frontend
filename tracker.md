# Tracker

I always use this file to keep track of everything that's on my dev plate. I never commit it to the repo, but for the purpose of the demonstration I am showing here how I work

This file has an .md extension for some IDE highlighting, but in general it does not output a pretty .md. We can consider this my custom format, which is a result of years of trying different things as I go. Best viewed in plaintext format
