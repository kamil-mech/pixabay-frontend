# Atoms

This project follows [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

This directory is intended to store atoms as described above

Think smallest reusable items

By default atoms should not have stories, unless they exercise a lot of variability (e.g. form components) or they are hardly accessible - it is likely they are included in other stories already
