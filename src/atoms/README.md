# Atoms

This project follows [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

This directory is intended to store atoms as described above

Think smallest reusable items

It's okay for some atoms to not have stories. It makes sense to include them when those components need to exercise a good bit of variability (e.g. form components) or they are hard to access in the app - it is likely they are included in other stories already
